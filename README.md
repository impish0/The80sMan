A sophisticated dark theme for Obsidian featuring a refined color palette designed for professional use and extended reading sessions.

## Color Scheme

This theme uses a carefully balanced palette that prioritizes readability and reduces eye strain while maintaining visual hierarchy:

- **Deep backgrounds** (#1a1a1a to #363636) provide modern depth without harsh contrast
- **Warm orange accents** (#e67e22, #f39c12) create approachable focal points for headers and interactive elements
- **Cool blue links** (#5dade2) ensure clear navigation while maintaining professional aesthetics
- **Sage green highlights** (#27ae60) provide positive feedback and success states
- **Graduated text hierarchy** uses subtle color variations to guide reading flow

The design philosophy balances professional sophistication with subtle warmth, creating an interface that feels both trustworthy and approachable.
